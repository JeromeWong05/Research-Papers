# Research-Papers

I have completed 4 original research projects individually throughout the course of highschool, and below is a brief description of what each project is about. Feel free to have a look if you find the topics interesting ðŸ˜Š!

### 1. Physics - Inclined Spring Mass Experiment
The inspiration behind this experiment setup was to simulate how a spirng mass system would behave under a different gravitational field strength, and we can achieve so by inclining the pendulumn. The objective is to determine how the angle between the vertical plane and the inclined pendulumn connected to a spring affect its period of oscillation.

I tested different inclination angles of that pendulumn and captured its motion with a slow motion camera. With the aid of a video analysis software, Tracker, I was able to model its position vs time, and was able to extract its period. 

### 2. Physics - Variable Mass Atwood Machine Experiment
This is an extension to the very commonly explored "Rocket problem" in undergraduate physics textbooks. The objective is to investigate how the diameter of a sand leaking funnel affect the total falling time of a continuously gaining mass Atwood system.

I made measurements using the same method as the previous experiment, where I tracked the position of the bucket using Tracker, and was able to determine the falling time. 

### 3. Chemistry - Fluorescence Experiment 
This experiment is closely related as an extension from the Electron Configuration topic. The goal of this experiment was to determine the effect of different pH levels of fluorescein solutions have on the relative fluorescence intensity measured using a spectrometer when the solution was excited at its specific excitation wavelength.

### 4. Math - Submarine Modelling
The goal of this paper was to model the Virginia Class Submarine with relatively simple geometries and compute the relative water to air volumes needed for that submarine to achieve neutral buoyancy. The submarine was modelled using two hemispheres and a cylinder with a thickness. I was able to achieve an approximation of the water to air ratio using simple vector calculus.
